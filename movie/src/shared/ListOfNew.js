     info: " In bad news for Titanic director James Cameron, another film has overtaken the epic seagoing romantic disaster movie on the list of all-time global box office success. In good news for Avatar: The Way Of Water director… (checks notes) James Cameron, his sci-fi sequel was the movie to pull off the trick. Yes, even with Titanic's recent re-release, The Way Of Water has now taken $2.2433 billion globally, nudging it ahead of Titanic's $2.2428 billion. So once again, a lot of water has proven to be a problem for the giant ship. Still, Cameron will no doubt be pleased to see the new movie doing so well, especially given the less favourable box office conditions under which The Way Of Water arrived. Still, the director's canny understanding of what brings crowds into cinemas and the desire to see it on the biggest screen possible.On the all-time list, The Way Of Water is now third behind Avengers: Endgame (with $2.7 billion) and a little movie called Avatar at $2.92 billion. While highly unlikely – though we've long learned not to bet against Jim Cameron – how funny would it be to see the director take out an ad in the trade magazines congratulating himself for overtaking himself?
